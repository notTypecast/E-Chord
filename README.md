# E-Chord
Chord DHT implementation in Python.

## Description
E-Chord is a python implementation of the Chord protocol, a peer-to-peer lookup service.

## Features
On top of the features of the base Chord protocol, the following ones have been updated or added:

- **Seed Server**: The new node learns the identity of an existing E-Chord node by contacting the [Seed Server](https://github.com/notTypecast/E-Chord-Seed).
- **Concurrent Joins**: Multiple nodes joining concurrently is supported using a periodic stabilization routine.
- **Handling Massive Node Failures**: Network consistency is preserved after multiple nodes fail simultaneously. The stabilization routine is responsible for keeping each node's successor up to date.
- **Data Storage**: Each node can hold data in key-value pairs. Any node can be contacted to store such a pair, but the pair will be stored in a node determined by the network. As new nodes join the network, data is tranferred to them accordingly.
- **Load Balancing**: Data is shared between multiple nodes, such that no one node holds a much larger amount of keys than others. In this way, the load is balanced between the nodes.
- **Data Consistency**: Data inserted into the network has a very high probability not to be lost, even if multiple nodes join or leave the network concurrently.
- **Ring Split Prevention**: By having each node keep a successor list of size log(n), where n is the maximum number of nodes that can join the network, it is guaranteed that, in most situations, a massive node failure will not split the ring into multiple inconsistent parts.

## Simulation Scripts

## Potential Improvements
- **Data Backups**: If a node fails abruptly, all the data it contains will be lost. Data should be replicated across nodes to preserve consistency, even after massive node failures.
